food you eat. Your body’s cells need glucose for energy; glucose comes from the carbohydrates you eat. A hormone called insulin must be present for glucose to get into the cell to be used as fuel. When you have diabetes your body either does not produce any or enough insulin or the cells do not recognize the insulin. Without insulin the glucose stays in your bloodstream and causes high blood glucose (high blood sugar). High blood sugar can lead to many health problems. It can affect your heart,

(high blood sugar). High blood sugar can lead to many health problems. It can affect your heart, kidneys, eyes, feet, digestion, and sexual function. The good news ... even if you develop these problems they can often be treated or prevented from getting worse! 3 There are different types of Diabetes Type 1 Diabetes If you have type 1 diabetes your body does not make any insulin.

type of diabetes must take insulin every day to survive. Insulin can be taken as daily injections or by using an insulin pump. Type 2 Diabetes This type includes most people who have diabetes. Your body makes SOME insu- lin, but not enough, and the cells may not use the insulin properly, this is called “insulin resistance”. Treatment usually begins with medications, but can include insulin or other injectable medications. When insulin is added it doesn’t mean your diabetes is ‘bad’ or getting

injectable medications. When insulin is added it doesn’t mean your diabetes is ‘bad’ or getting worse, or that you have failed. Gestational Diabetes A type of diabetes that develops in pregnancy. Treatment starts with diet and exercise, but can include medications and insulin. It is important to continue to screen for diabetes after the pregnancy, because you are at a greater risk for developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. 4 How often should I check my Blood Sugars?

Type 2 diabetes later in life. 4 How often should I check my Blood Sugars? Your provider (MD, APRN, PA, etc.) will tell you how many times to check. The best times to check are: Before meals, 2 hours after a meal, or at bedtime. There may be times that you may need to check your blood sugar more often than usual. This is when you are sick, pregnant, changing or adding medications, or have been experiencing high or low readings. … and what should my readings be? Before a meal: 70-130 mg/dl 2

experiencing high or low readings. … and what should my readings be? Before a meal: 70-130 mg/dl 2 hours after a meal: <140-180 mg/dl These target ranges may be different for each person. Ask your provider for YOUR specific target ranges. The only way to know if your diabetes treatment is working is by checking your blood sugar level. 5 Checking your Blood Sugars at home To check your blood sugars at home you will need a glucose meter along with testing strips and lancets. • To begin wash your

Educate Your Patients about Kidney Stones A REFERENCE GUIDE FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS Kidney stones Kidney stones can be a serious problem. A kidney stone is a hard object that is made from chemicals in the urine. There are five types of kidney stones:  Calcium oxalate: Most common, created when calcium combines with oxalate in the urine.  Calcium phosphate: Can be associated with hyperparathyroidism and renal tubular acidosis.  Uric acid: Can be associated with a diet high in animal

and renal tubular acidosis.  Uric acid: Can be associated with a diet high in animal protein.  Struvite: Less common, caused by infections in the upper urinary tract.  Cystine: Rare and tend to run in families with a history of cystinuria. People who had a kidney stone are at higher risk of having another stone. Kidney stones may also increase the risk of kidney disease. Symptoms A stone that is small enough can pass through the ureter with no symptoms. However, if the stone is large enough,
===CHUNK===
small enough can pass through the ureter with no symptoms. However, if the stone is large enough, it may stay in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract into the ureter. Stones that don’t move may cause significant pain, urinary outflow obstruction, or other health problems. Possible symptoms include severe pain on either side of the lower back, more vague pain or stomach ache that doesn’t go away, blood in the urine, nausea or vomiting, fever and chills, or urine that smells bad or looks
===CHUNK===
away, blood in the urine, nausea or vomiting, fever and chills, or urine that smells bad or looks cloudy. Speak with a healthcare professional if you feel any of these symptoms. Risk factors Risk factors can include a family or personal history of kidney stones, diets high in protein, salt, or sugar, obesity, or digestive diseases or surgeries. Dehydration (Excessive sweating or not drinking enough water) can also increase your risk for kidney stones. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a kidney stone

Diagnosis Diagnosis of a kidney stone starts with a medical history, physical examination, and certain tests:  Imaging tests are used to find out exact shape and size of the stone. This can be done with a high resolution CT scan. Other imaging options may include a KUB x-ray, or an intravenous pyelogram. Urine and blood tests measure the levels of calcium, phosphorus and uric acid in the blood will be measured. The stone can also

the levels of calcium, phosphorus and uric acid in the blood will be measured. The stone can also analyzed after it comes out. This can be used to find out possible causes and help plan for prevention of future stones. Treatment Initial treatment options can include drinking more water and medications either for pain or to help the stone pass. Depending on the type of stone, these medicines can include allopurinol (for uric acid stones), antibiotics (for struvite stones), thiazide diuretics
===CHUNK===
include allopurinol (for uric acid stones), antibiotics (for struvite stones), thiazide diuretics (water pills), phosphate solutions, sodium bicarbonate, citrate, or tamsulosin (to relax the ureter and help the stone pass). If these treatments do not work then medical procedures may be needed to break down larger stones or remove them. Shock Wave Lithotripsy uses high energy shock waves to break stones into smaller pieces for passing. Ureteroscopy uses a small scope to remove the stone.

break stones into smaller pieces for passing. Ureteroscopy uses a small scope to remove the stone. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy removes the stone surgically from the back. Prevention  Drinking enough water each day is important in maintaining overall health. Eight to ten glasses a day is a common recommendation for daily hydration. Fluid restrictions might also apply if you have advanced kidney disease, so speak with a healthcare professional about the right amount.  Beware of activities
===CHUNK===
disease, so speak with a healthcare professional about the right amount.  Beware of activities associated with excessive sweating.  Eat a healthy diet and maintain a healthy weight.  Manage blood pressure and sodium intake.  Citrate might also be used to help prevent certain stones if urine citrate is low and urine pH levels are too low (or too acidic). • Citrus juices contain citrate (citric acid), but large amounts might be needed. Also, be careful of sugar. Lemon juice concentrate (4 oz

acid), but large amounts might be needed. Also, be careful of sugar. Lemon juice concentrate (4 oz per day) mixed with water can be considered. The citrate content of most fruits and vegetables contains both alkali (less acidic) citrate and citric acid, however, only the alkali citrate is excreted in the urine to raise urine citrate and pH levels. • Alkali citrate can be prescribed and is available over-the-counter. It can come in a pill, liquid or powder. Alkali citrate is given with a

available over-the-counter. It can come in a pill, liquid or powder. Alkali citrate is given with a mineral(s), such as sodium, potassium or magnesium to help prevent stone formation. The aim is to increase urine citrate (for prevention of calcium stones) and increase urine pH (or make urine less acidic or more alkaline, for prevention of uric acid and cystine stones). The goal is to keep pH in balance. • People should remember to speak with a doctor or other healthcare professional about which

• People should remember to speak with a doctor or other healthcare professional about which treatment options are right for them, including over-the-counter products and home remedies. People with kidney disease should also be aware that they may be asked to watch their intake of sodium, potassium or other minerals. Recommendations may depend on the stage of kidney disease, or other factors  Other preventive steps can depend on the type of stone. • Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate:
===CHUNK===
 Other preventive steps can depend on the type of stone. • Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate: Thiazide diuretics can decrease urinary calcium excretion. Consuming the recommended daily allowance of calcium is important for patients with calcium oxalate stones since calcium binds up oxalate in the gut, decreasing available urinary oxalate. • Uric acid: To reduce uric acid stones, cut down on high-purine foods such as red meat, organ meats, and shellfish. Sodium bicarbonate can also be used
===CHUNK===
high-purine foods such as red meat, organ meats, and shellfish. Sodium bicarbonate can also be used to alkalinize the urine (or make it less acidic). • Cystine: These stones are less able to form in urine that is less acidic. Eating more fruits and vegetables can help make the urine less acidic. Eating meat can lead to urine that has more acid, which can increase the risk for cystine stones. • Struvite: Thought to be caused by certain bacterial infections (urinary tract infections, or UTI).

food you eat. Your body’s cells need glucose for energy; glucose comes from the carbohydrates you eat. A hormone called insulin must be present for glucose to get into the cell to be used as fuel. When you have diabetes your body either does not produce any or enough insulin or the cells do not recognize the insulin. Without insulin the glucose stays in your bloodstream and causes high blood glucose (high blood sugar). High blood sugar can lead to many health problems. It can affect your heart,

(high blood sugar). High blood sugar can lead to many health problems. It can affect your heart, kidneys, eyes, feet, digestion, and sexual function. The good news ... even if you develop these problems they can often be treated or prevented from getting worse! 3 There are different types of Diabetes Type 1 Diabetes If you have type 1 diabetes your body does not make any insulin.

type of diabetes must take insulin every day to survive. Insulin can be taken as daily injections or by using an insulin pump. Type 2 Diabetes This type includes most people who have diabetes. Your body makes SOME insu- lin, but not enough, and the cells may not use the insulin properly, this is called “insulin resistance”. Treatment usually begins with medications, but can include insulin or other injectable medications. When insulin is added it doesn’t mean your diabetes is ‘bad’ or getting

injectable medications. When insulin is added it doesn’t mean your diabetes is ‘bad’ or getting worse, or that you have failed. Gestational Diabetes A type of diabetes that develops in pregnancy. Treatment starts with diet and exercise, but can include medications and insulin. It is important to continue to screen for diabetes after the pregnancy, because you are at a greater risk for developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. 4 How often should I check my Blood Sugars?

Type 2 diabetes later in life. 4 How often should I check my Blood Sugars? Your provider (MD, APRN, PA, etc.) will tell you how many times to check. The best times to check are: Before meals, 2 hours after a meal, or at bedtime. There may be times that you may need to check your blood sugar more often than usual. This is when you are sick, pregnant, changing or adding medications, or have been experiencing high or low readings. … and what should my readings be? Before a meal: 70-130 mg/dl 2

experiencing high or low readings. … and what should my readings be? Before a meal: 70-130 mg/dl 2 hours after a meal: <140-180 mg/dl These target ranges may be different for each person. Ask your provider for YOUR specific target ranges. The only way to know if your diabetes treatment is working is by checking your blood sugar level. 5 Checking your Blood Sugars at home To check your blood sugars at home you will need a glucose meter along with testing strips and lancets. • To begin wash your

===CHUNK===
Internal Carotid Vertebral Artery Artery Blood vessels that carry blood to the brain from the heart are called arteries. The brain needs a constant supply of blood, which carries the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function. Specific arteries supply blood to specific areas of the brain. A stroke occurs when one of these arteries to the brain is either blocked or bursts. As a result, part of the brain does not get the blood it needs, so it starts to die. 3 Blood Flow in Normal and Blocked
===CHUNK===
the brain does not get the blood it needs, so it starts to die. 3 Blood Flow in Normal and Blocked Arteries NORMAL ARTERY Blood flows easily through a clear artery. BLOCKAGE An artery can become blocked by plaque (a fatty substance in the wall of the artery) or a blood clot, which reduces blood flow to the brain and causes a stroke. This picture shows atherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis is caused partly by cholesterol or plaque buildup. Atherosclerosis Clot CLOT
===CHUNK===
Atherosclerosis is caused partly by cholesterol or plaque buildup. Atherosclerosis Clot CLOT DISSOLVES A transient ischemic attack or TIA has the same signs and symptoms of a stroke, but they only last a short time. The plaque or blood clot breaks up and blood flow is restored to the brain and there is no permanent damage. A TIA is serious and needs to be evaluated by a health care provider. 4 Blood Flow to the Brain Area at Risk Lodged Blood Clot This picture shows a blood clot blocking an

Blood Flow to the Brain Area at Risk Lodged Blood Clot This picture shows a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain. Without enough blood flow, brain cells begin to die. 5 Arteriography The doctor will take an x-ray picture of your brain, called an arteriogram or angiogram. A dye is injected into the blood vessels that lead to the brain. The dye will show up on the x-ray and help locate blocked, narrowed or damaged blood vessels in the brain. 6 Ischemic Stroke Blood Clot Cardiovascular
===CHUNK===
narrowed or damaged blood vessels in the brain. 6 Ischemic Stroke Blood Clot Cardiovascular System Ischemic Stroke Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. An ischemic stroke happens when an artery in the brain is blocked. There are two types of ischemic stroke: Embolic Stroke: In an embolic stroke, a blood clot or plaque fragment forms, usually in the heart or the large arteries leading to the brain, and then moves through the arteries to the brain. In the brain, the clot blocks a
===CHUNK===
to the brain, and then moves through the arteries to the brain. In the brain, the clot blocks a blood vessel and leads to a stroke. Thrombotic Stroke: A thrombotic stroke is a blood clot that forms inside an artery that supplies blood to the brain. The clot interrupts blood flow and causes a stroke. 7 Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Interior Cerebral Artery Middle Cerebral Artery Blockage Internal Carotid Artery If an artery in the brain or one that goes to the brain is blocked for a short
===CHUNK===
Carotid Artery If an artery in the brain or one that goes to the brain is blocked for a short time, blood flow slows down or stops. This can cause a transient ischemic attack, sometimes called a mini-stroke. A TIA’s major symptoms include sudden: • Numbness, weakness or paralysis of the face, arm or leg, usually on one side of the body • Loss of vision in one or both eyes or double vision • Trouble speaking or difficulty understanding others • Loss of balance or coordination • Severe headache
===CHUNK===
speaking or difficulty understanding others • Loss of balance or coordination • Severe headache with no known cause When a TIA happens, the artery either becomes unblocked after a short time or a new path opens up and blood flow is normal. Symptoms last for a short time and then disappear. A TIA is a serious warning that you might have a stroke. 8 Hemorrhagic Stroke Cerebral Hemorrhage A hemorrhagic stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills blood into or around the
===CHUNK===
stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills blood into or around the brain. High blood pressure and aneurysms (see page 12) can make blood vessels weak enough to burst. There are different types of hemorrhagic stroke, including intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 9 Intracerebral Hemorrhage Cerebral Hemorrhage Middle Internal Cerebral Carotid Artery Artery Normal Vessel Bulging Vessel Burst Vessel One kind of hemorrhagic stroke is called an intracerebral
===CHUNK===
Normal Vessel Bulging Vessel Burst Vessel One kind of hemorrhagic stroke is called an intracerebral hemorrhage. This kind of stroke is caused when a burst blood vessel bleeds into brain tissue. The bleeding causes brain cells to die and the part of the brain that is affected stops working correctly. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is the most common cause of this type of stroke. 10 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Subarachnoid Space Middle Cerebral Artery Saccular Aneurysm Subarachnoid

10 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Subarachnoid Space Middle Cerebral Artery Saccular Aneurysm Subarachnoid Space (in Blue) Between Skull and Brain (enlarged view) Another kind of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this type of stroke, a blood vessel bursts near the surface of the brain and blood leaks into the space between the brain and the skull (the subarachnoid space). Blood that collects in this space puts pressure on brain tissue and causes blood vessels to spasm. This

that collects in this space puts pressure on brain tissue and causes blood vessels to spasm. This type of stroke can be caused by different things but is usually caused by a burst aneurysm. 11 Aneurysm Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysm Saccular Aneurysm Ruptured Saccular Aneurysm An aneurysm is a weak spot on the wall of an artery that bulges out into a thin bubble. As it gets bigger, the wall may weaken and burst. If it bursts, blood leaks inside or around the brain. 12 How a Stroke Affects You

Do these things to prevent another stroke. If you have high blood pressure, lower it. Measurement of 130/80 mm Hg and above is considered high blood pressure, work with your health care
===CHUNK===
Measurement of 130/80 mm Hg and above is considered high blood pressure, work with your health care provider to manage it. Find out if you have atrial fibrillation (AFib). AFib is a quivering or irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots and cause a stroke. Your health care provider can tell you if you have AFib and help you manage it. If you smoke, stop. Smoking doubles the risk for stroke. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Heavy drinking can increase your risk for stroke. Lower
===CHUNK===
If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Heavy drinking can increase your risk for stroke. Lower your cholesterol (the fat-like substance in your blood). Studies suggest ideal total cholesterol levels at about 150 mg/dL, which equals about 100 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Lower cholesterol levels are linked with lower rates of heart disease and stroke. If you have diabetes, follow your health care provider’s advice carefully to get your blood sugar level under
===CHUNK===
diabetes, follow your health care provider’s advice carefully to get your blood sugar level under control. Having diabetes puts you at an increased risk for stroke. Talk to your health care provider about a diet that will help you manage your diabetes, such as limiting foods high in added sugars. Exercise daily. Even a little exercise—a brisk walk, swim or yard work—can improve your health and may reduce your stroke risk. Check with your health care provider before starting a new exercise

Information for Behavioral Health Providers in Primary Care Asthma What is Asthma? Asthma (AZ-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts in childhood. In the United States, more than 22 million people are

ages, but it most often starts in childhood. In the United States, more than 22 million people are known to have asthma. Nearly 6 million of these people are children. Overview The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of the lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. This makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. They tend to react strongly to certain substances that are breathed in. When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This causes the airways to
===CHUNK===
breathed in. When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This causes the airways to narrow, and less air flows to the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways may make more mucus than normal. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways. This chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are irritated. Sometimes symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after
===CHUNK===
each time the airways are irritated. Sometimes symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with an asthma medicine. At other times, symptoms continue to get worse. When symptoms get more intense and/or additional symptoms appear, this is an asthma attack. Asthma attacks also are called flare-ups or exacerbations.

It's important to treat symptoms when first noticed. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can cause death. Outlook Asthma can't be cured. Even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time.

Researchers think a combination of factors (family genes and certain environmental exposures) interact to cause asthma to develop, most often early in life. These factors include: An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe)  Asthma Information Sheet Ver3.0 – July 2013 Page - 2 Asthma Information

most often starts in childhood. In the United States, more than 22 million people are known to have asthma. Nearly 6 million of these people are children. Young children, who have frequent episodes of wheezing with respiratory infections, as well as certain other risk factors, are at the highest risk of developing asthma that continues beyond 6 years of age. These risk factors include having allergies, eczema (an allergic skin condition), or parents who have asthma. Among children, more boys

eczema (an allergic skin condition), or parents who have asthma. Among children, more boys have asthma than girls. But among adults, more women have the disease than men. It's not clear whether or how sex and sex hormones play a role in causing asthma. Most, but not all, people who have asthma have allergies. Some people develop asthma because of exposure to certain chemical irritants or industrial dusts in the workplace. This is called occupational asthma. What are the Signs and Symptoms of

Other factors that do affect you may not be on the list. Talk to your doctor about the things that seem to make your asthma worse. How is Asthma Diagnosed? Primary care doctors will diagnose asthma based on medical history, a physical exam, and results from tests. He or she also will determine the level of

"rescue," medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Initial asthma treatment will depend on how severe the disease is. Follow-up asthma treatment will depend on how well the patient’s asthma action plan is working to control symptoms and prevent asthma attacks.

Tuberculosis (TB) What is Tuberculosis? Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called the mycobacterium. It invades the lungs, but can also invade other parts of the body, including the kidney, brain, and spinal cord. How does tuberculosis infection spread? Tuberculosis is transmitted through flying droplets from one person to another when sneezing, coughing and spitting or through direct contact or breathing contaminated air. However, it is not transmitted through: •
===CHUNK===
or through direct contact or breathing contaminated air. However, it is not transmitted through: • Handshaking. • Sharing foods and drinks. • Kissing. • Using bathrooms. When someone is infected, tuberculosis follows one of two known patterns: • Either they become carriers without showing any symptoms of the disease while the bacteria remain inactive thanks to the body's immunity against it. In this case, it is not infectious but may later be activated. • Or they have active tuberculosis, and
===CHUNK===
this case, it is not infectious but may later be activated. • Or they have active tuberculosis, and therefore show symptoms of infection. In this case, they can transmit the disease to others. It should be known that the symptoms only appear several weeks after the infection, or even months or years later. Symptoms: • Persistent cough for three weeks or longer. • Coughing up blood. • Chest pain that worsens when breathing or coughing. • Loss of appetite and weight. • Laziness. • High fever. •
===CHUNK===
that worsens when breathing or coughing. • Loss of appetite and weight. • Laziness. • High fever. • Sweating, especially at night. • Blood in urine in case the kidneys become infected. • Back pain in case the spleen becomes infected. People at Higher Risk: • People with HIV and AIDS. • Diabetic patients. • Some cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. • People who have undergone organ transplantation and are now on immunosuppressive drugs. • People taking certain drugs to treat rheumatism and
===CHUNK===
and are now on immunosuppressive drugs. • People taking certain drugs to treat rheumatism and psoriasis. • Living in or travelling to areas with high incidence of tuberculosis, such as: South Africa, India, China, Mexico and some East Asian countries. • Having daily contact with an infected person. Therefore, caution should be taken to wear a face mask and wash hands frequently when coming into contact with their personal tools. Diagnosis: Two tests are performed for suspected patients: • Skin
===CHUNK===
with their personal tools. Diagnosis: Two tests are performed for suspected patients: • Skin Test: It is performed by injecting a fluid (tuberculin) into the skin of the lower part of the arm. The reaction on the arm is then examined two to three days later. In the event of developing a swelling or induration on the injected area, the diameter is measured, and the test is deemed positive if the diameter is equal to or greater than 10 mm. This indicates the presence of the tuberculosis- causing
===CHUNK===
is equal to or greater than 10 mm. This indicates the presence of the tuberculosis- causing bacteria. • Blood Test: The test is known as IGRAs. It measures the body reaction to the tuberculosis-causing bacteria. If positive, the diagnosis is confirmed by further tests to assess disease activity. Other tests to determine disease activity: • Physical examination (signs and symptoms). • X-ray scans. • Sputum examination to detect and identify bacteria. • Checking for family history of
===CHUNK===
X-ray scans. • Sputum examination to detect and identify bacteria. • Checking for family history of tuberculosis. Treatment: Tuberculosis treatment takes a long time ranging from 6 to 9 months. Drugs used to treat tuberculosis are: • Isoniazid. • Rifampin. • Ethambutol. • Pyrazinamide. After several weeks of treatment, the patient begins to feel better and becomes less likely to be contagious. However, treatment should be continued for the whole course as prescribed. Anti-tuberculosis Drug
===CHUNK===
However, treatment should be continued for the whole course as prescribed. Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance: It is the ability of bacteria to resist the drugs used for treatment. This resistance occurs because of irregular use of drugs or discontinued treatment before the end of the prescribed course. Prevention of Tuberculosis: Patients with active tuberculosis are advised to: • Stay home or in a private room (especially during the first weeks of infection). • Air the room constantly. • Cover

Lifetime prevalence rates for depression range from 7% to 12% in men and 20% to 25% in women. Depression negatively affects patients’ perception of health [22]. An estimated 40-50% of risk for depression is genetically determined [24]. However, no single vulnerability gene has been indentified yet, indicating a far more complex interplay of genetic and environmental factor underlying the causative etiology of this disorder [19]. Depression is associated with a serious impairment of social,

Genetic and Environmental Causes of Depression The specific cause of major depressive disorder is not known. As with most psychiatric disorders, depression appears to be multifactorial in its origin.

Depression is a complex phenomenon with many genes possibly involved. Thus, any single gene might produce a relatively small effect and would there- fore be

It is also possible that variants in different genes may contribute to depression in each family, which further complicates of the search for depression genes.

DIAGNOSIS OF A MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE Despite its prominent clinical, psychosocial, and economic burdens, depression has been under recognised and undertreated. Only a small proportion of depressed subjects (<10%) receive appropriate treatment or drug treatment of a sufficient dosage and duration [17]. Reasons may include inadequate access to care, under diagnosis, under treatment, poor patient compliance, fear of stigmatisation, and preference for alternative psychosocial therapy. Diagnosis

compliance, fear of stigmatisation, and preference for alternative psychosocial therapy. Diagnosis of major depression is based on standardized clinical criteria published by the American Psychiatric Association in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [10]. The criteria for the diagnosis of an episode include at least minimum two weeks of depressed mood or anhedonia plus four of seven other features that are sufficient to cause clinically important psychological or physical

of seven other features that are sufficient to cause clinically important psychological or physical distress or functional impairment. These features include a weight change of 5 percent or more in one month or a persistent change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia on most days, changes in psychomotor state, fatigue, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, diminished concentration and decisiveness, and suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt. Conversely, major depression may be missed when

Typically, symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, constipation, disturbed sleep, energies, loss of libido, vague aches and pains, and deficiencies in memory and concentration may result in a missed diagnosis, particularly if the patient does not spontaneously report low mood or other psychological symptoms,

particularly if the patient does not spontaneously report low mood or other psychological symptoms, such as guilt, hopelessness, anxiety, suicidal ideation, or prior suicide attempts. Delusions of guilt and somatic illness complicate up to 14 percent of major depressive episodes, especially postpartum depression [16].

Since the 1960s, Depression has been diagnosed as “major depression’’ based on symptomatic criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statically Manual.

diseases of distinct causes and pathophysiologies [10]. TYPES OF DEPRESSION Depression is a common, chronic, and potentially debilitating illness that has tempered the human condition since the beginning of recorded history. The annual incidence of mood disorders is estimated to range from 7% to 12% of the population [22,16]. The unipolar depression (in which mood swings are always in the same direction), is of two types- reactive and endogenous. The reactive depression is more common (about

The reactive depression is more common (about 75% cases), nonfamilial, clearly associated with stressful life events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation. On the other hand, patients of endogenous depression (about 25% of cases) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology [4,17]. 446 Ashwani Arya et al J.

Res., 2011, 3(2):444-453 ______________________________________________________________________________ Major Depressive Episode Recurrent episodes of major depression, which is a common and serious illness, are called major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder accounts for 4.4 percent of the total overall global disease burden [22,14]. Dysthymia (Minor Depression) It is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which

The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression [7,41]. Bipolar Disorder It’s previously known as manic-depressive disorder, is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of mania or hypomania. Although

is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of mania or hypomania. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum [6,17,10]. Cyclothymia It is a mild form of bipolar disorder, characterized by recurring episodes of hypomania and depression [41]. Melancholic Depression It is characterized by a loss of

episodes of hypomania and depression [41]. Melancholic Depression It is characterized by a loss of pleasure in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of grief or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early morning waking, psychomotor retardation, excessive weight loss or excessive guilt [10,18]. Atypical Depression It is associated with labile mood, hypersomnia, increased appetite & weight gain,

symptoms. Here the person is mute and almost stuporose, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements [10,28]. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF DEPRESSION The majority of subsequent hypotheses suggest that depression arises from the deregulation of one or more neurotransmitters or neuroregulators in areas of the brain involved in mood regulation, e.g., the cerebral cortex and limbic system [2]. The heritability of depression suggests that, in some patients, there

cortex and limbic system [2]. The heritability of depression suggests that, in some patients, there is a genetic predisposition to the development of this altered neurobiology. Particularly strong evidence exists for a preeminent role of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), possibly dopamine (DA), and the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor in pathophysiology of Depression [9,27,37]. Some evidence also exists for a role of substance P in depressive

of Depression [9,27,37]. Some evidence also exists for a role of substance P in depressive disorders [23]. Consonant with such hypotheses, a host of deficiencies in serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, somatostatin, and thyroid-related hormones — have been proposed as contributing to depression. Furthermore, over activity in still other neurotransmitter systems involving acetylcholine, corticotropin-releasing factor, and substance P
===CHUNK===
neurotransmitter systems involving acetylcholine, corticotropin-releasing factor, and substance P are thought to be implicated in depression [20]. Furthermore, recent research has suggested that 447 Ashwani Arya et al J. Chem. Pharm.

of a variety of neural systems. The function of intracellular cascades initiated by the actions of neurotransmitters may therefore be altered in depression, leading to downstream changes in neural function. Despite its prevalence and social impact, its prognosis and management are often poor, not only due to the heterogeneity of this ailment, but also our lack of knowledge of the pathophysiology underlying depression [35]. • Monoamines: 5-HT, NE, and DA, are widely distributed neurotransmitter

The implication that dysfunction of monoamine systems may be involved in the etiology of depression has been the subject of considerable research [37].

MAO converts catecholamine into their corresponding aldehydes, which in periphery, are rapidly metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to corresponding carboxylic acid. In case of nor- adrenaline, this yields dehydroxy-mandelic acid. MAO can also oxidize other monoamines like dopamine (DA) and serotonin. MAO is enzyme protein responsible for metabolizing monoamines like NE, DA and 5-HT. MAO is found in nearly all tissues. MAO exists in

MAO-A has substrate preference for serotonin and is the main target for the antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAO-B has substrate preference for phenylethyl amine. Both enzymes act on nor-adrenaline and dopamine. In case of depression the level of monoamine oxidase enzyme in brain is increased which in turn reduce the levels

the level of monoamine oxidase enzyme in brain is increased which in turn reduce the levels of monoamines [13]. • Norepinephrine: Noradrenergic cell bodies in the brainstem (lateral tegmental area and locus coeruleus) give rise to diverse projections to a variety of brain structures. The latter structure in the pons gives rise to 70% of the NE innervating the forebrain. The noradrenergic system is intimately involved in the mediation of stress responses.

The locus coeruleus is sensitive to both external environmental stimuli and internal changes in homeostasis, and receives inputs from numerous other neurotransmitter systems, including 5-HT, opioid, alpha- aminobutyric acid (GABA), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), DA, and glutamate, which feed back information on the state of internal homeostasis [2].

The NE released following activation of noradrenergic neurons mediates effects through interaction with alpha and beta adrenoceptors, which may be present both pre- and postsynaptically [35]. Although there is more controversy surrounding a putative role for NE system dysfunction than for 5-HT circuits in the neurobiology of depression, a number of studies have suggested that a dysfunction of NE neurons and/or changes in adrenergic receptor sensitivity may be important in the
===CHUNK===
dysfunction of NE neurons and/or changes in adrenergic receptor sensitivity may be important in the etiology of depression [2]. • Serotonin Transporter Function and Depressive Behaviour: Serotonin mediates inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system [35]. From cell bodies concentrated in the dorsal and caudal raphe nuclei, widespread serotonergic projections extend to a considerable variety of brain areas believed to be associated with the symptoms of

extend to a considerable variety of brain areas believed to be associated with the symptoms of depression, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and brainstem. The serotonergic system is therefore anatomically well situated to mediate the signs and symptoms of depression, because these are so diverse that they could not possibly be mediated by just one brain region. The effects of serotonin are mediated through 5- HT receptors, of which at least 13 molecular

The effects of serotonin are mediated through 5- HT receptors, of which at least 13 molecular subtypes are present, including three major receptor 448 Ashwani Arya et al J. Chem. Pharm.

There is overwhelming evidence indicating a relative deficiency of 5-HT in most or all forms of depression. This evidence has been obtained from neuroendocrine studies, demonstrating blunted hormonal responses to serotonergic stimuli, from studies of the levels of 5-HT metabolites in postmortem tissue and cerebrospinal fluid

from studies of the levels of 5-HT metabolites in postmortem tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), selective depletion studies of 5-HT in depressed patients, alterations in the 5-HT transporter and receptors in functional brain imaging studies and post-mortem tissue studies, and through study of the mechanism of action of antidepressant agents [35]. • Dopamine: The DA system in the brain, in contrast to the 5-HT and NE circuits, comprises point-to-point topographical projections from particular

Dopaminergic neurons are organized in three main pathways: the mesolimbic- mesocortical pathway linking midbrain DA cell groups with limbic and cortical regions; the nigrostriatal pathway; and the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which comprises an intrinsic hypothalamic DA pathway that modulates the anterior pituitary gland.

Dopaminergic neurons therefore innervate brain areas associated with behavioral and physiological functions that are altered in depression (e.g., the cortex, limbic structures, and pituitary gland) [9,35,37]. • Selective Depletion of Serotonin and Norepinephrine: Further evidence indicating that reduced levels of 5-HT is related to the development of depression is provided by the observation that depletion of 5-HT levels is

Thus, these symptoms result from the depletion of all monoamine stores, including 5-HT, by administration of reserpine or the reduction of central 5-HT levels by the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Furthermore, depletion of tryptophan (the biosynthetic precursor of 5-HT) by use of a special diet causes a rapid

Many effects of 5-HT, such as the regulation of mood, anxiety, and body temperature, and control of sexual function, sleep, obsessive-compulsive behavior, eating behavior, hallucinations, psychosis, and panic attack, are thought to be mediated by an interaction of 5-HT with postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors.

In order to maintain glucocorticoids within physiological range, the HPA axis is controlled by multiple negative feedback loops mediated mainly by the steroids themselves.

one of the most consistent biological markers [38]. • Corticotropin-Releasing Factor: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is known to be activated in many patients with depression and there is considerable evidence that this is driven by hyperactivity of hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) pathways. CRF is a hypothalamic hypophycotropic factor that controls the release of corticotropin from the anterior pituitary gland. In turn, corticotropin
===CHUNK===
controls the release of corticotropin from the anterior pituitary gland. In turn, corticotropin stimulates the adrenal cortex to release hormones essential for the organism’s response to stress (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids). In addition to this neuroendocrine role, CRF plays a central role in coordinating the behavioral, autonomic, and immune responses to stress. Indeed, CRF is present in a variety of extrahypothalamic brain regions (the locus coeruleus and amygdala, which suggests a

An abnormality in glutamate function has been implicated in the neural substrate of depression [25]. People with depression also exhibit elevated basal levels of both cortisol and CRF [15]. • Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and Depression: The overlap in symptoms between patients with hypothyroidism and those with major depression has led to number

in symptoms between patients with hypothyroidism and those with major depression has led to number of studies on HPT axis in patients with mood disorders. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates TRH receptors in the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) which in turn stimulates specific receptors in the pituitary to release tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4) hormones. Thyroid hormones provide feed back to both the hypothalamus

(T3) and thyroxin (T4) hormones. Thyroid hormones provide feed back to both the hypothalamus and pituitary to regulate the axis. CSF TRH was increased in two small studies of depressed patients as compared to control. In one study, depressed patients with high normal thyroid levels were also reported to demonstrate exaggerated TSH responses to TRH. • BDNF and Depression: In humans, brain BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic factor) levels have been found to be reduced in postmortem samples from

(Brain derived neurotrophic factor) levels have been found to be reduced in postmortem samples from depressed patients. BDNF is found in blood, where it mostly accumulates in platelets. Interestingly, several studies have found decreased blood levels of BDNF in depressed patients [21]. The BDNF gene has a 450 Ashwani Arya et al J. Chem. Pharm.

===CHUNK===
complex genetic structure with seven upstream exons and one coding exon that give rise to multiple splice variants, each controlled by distinct promoters. Various polymorphisms are present in the human BDNF gene such as the functional val66met polymorphism that changes a valine to a methionine in the BDNF peptide [12]. The study implies that loss-of-function mutations in BDNF might predispose an individual to depression via dysregulation of the HPA system [26]. • Human Growth Hormone and

an individual to depression via dysregulation of the HPA system [26]. • Human Growth Hormone and Depression: Growth hormone (GH) is synthesized in anterior pituitary. Two hypothalamic hormones, growth hormone releasing factors (GHRF) and somatostatin (growth hormone inhibiting factor) modulate its release from the pituitary. The major neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation (e.g. nor-adernaline, serotonin and dopamine) affect GH release. CSF levels of somatostatin (which inhibits GH, CRH
===CHUNK===
serotonin and dopamine) affect GH release. CSF levels of somatostatin (which inhibits GH, CRH and ACTH release) are reduced in depression [1]. • Malondiadehyde and Depression: In case of stress and oxidative damage of the cells, malondialdehyde (MDA) is generated. The levels of brain MDA were more in stressed mice as compared to normal mice. • Inflammatory Cytokines and Depression: Increasing amount of data suggest that inflammatory responses have an important role in pathophysiology of

amount of data suggest that inflammatory responses have an important role in pathophysiology of depression [8]. Depressed patients have been found to have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, chemokines and cellular adhesion molecules. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines have been found to interact with many of the pathophysiological domains that characterize depression, including neurotransmitter metabolism, neuro-endocrine function, synaptic plasticity and

including neurotransmitter metabolism, neuro-endocrine function, synaptic plasticity and behavior. These findings suggest that targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines and their signaling pathways might represent a novel strategy to treat depression [34]. NEURAL CIRCUITRY OF DEPRESSION Brain imaging has identified numerous regions of altered structure or activity in the brain during major depression, suggesting disordered neurocircuitry in a variety of structures, such as the anterior and posterior

suggesting disordered neurocircuitry in a variety of structures, such as the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex; the ventral, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; the insula; the ventral striatum; the hippocampus; the medial thalamus; the amygdala; and the brain stem [33]. These brain areas regulate emotional, cognitive, autonomic, sleep, and stress- response behaviors that are impaired in mood disorders. Studies with the use of positron- emission tomography indicate a decrease in

Studies with the use of positron- emission tomography indicate a decrease in serotonin transporters as well as altered postsynaptic serotonin-receptor binding in many of the same brain regions, suggesting altered circuitry congruent with serotonin-system abnormalities.
